# API Navigation Property Solution

## Overview

This solution addresses the issue of navigation properties (virtual properties) being serialized in API responses, which was causing excessively large and deeply nested responses. 

## Implementation Details

We've implemented a solution that globally excludes all virtual properties (navigation properties) from being serialized in API responses without having to create DTOs for all entities.

### Key Components

1. **JsonIgnoreVirtualMembersConverter**: A custom JSON converter that automatically excludes all virtual properties during serialization.

2. **Program.cs Configuration**: The converter has been added to the global JSON serialization options.

### How It Works

- The converter identifies virtual properties in entity classes during serialization and skips them
- No need to add [JsonIgnore] attributes to all navigation properties
- Works with the existing ReferenceHandler.IgnoreCycles configuration to prevent circular references
- Properly handles collections and nested objects

## Benefits

- **No DTOs Required**: The solution works directly with entity objects
- **Clean and Maintainable**: Only one centralized piece of code to maintain
- **Consistent Behavior**: All API endpoints benefit from the same behavior
- **No Code Duplication**: No need to create mappings or conversion logic
- **API Response Size**: Significantly reduces API response size by excluding navigation properties

## Testing

You can test that navigation properties are excluded by:

1. Making API requests to any endpoint that returns entity objects
2. Looking at the logged output (we added logging to the ServicesNhanVTsController as an example)
3. Verifying that virtual navigation properties are not included in the response

## Customization

If you need to include specific navigation properties in certain scenarios:

1. Create a DTO for that specific scenario
2. Map the entity to the DTO and include only the navigation properties you need
3. Return the DTO from the API endpoint

## Performance Impact

This solution has minimal performance impact as it only adds a small amount of processing during JSON serialization.
